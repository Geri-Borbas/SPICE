# NASA's SPICE Toolkits for C
> An Observation Geometry System for Space Science Missions


[**NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility**](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/) (NAIF) offers NASA flight projects and NASA funded researchers an observation geometry information system named [**"SPICE"**](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/) to assist scientists in planning and interpreting scientific observations from space-based instruments aboard robotic spacecraft. SPICE is also widely used in mission engineering tasks associated with these missions.


## Attribution

This repository simply collects (and compiles) official [**SPICE Toolkit C sources**](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html) (version N0066) available to the public at [**naif.jpl.nasa.gov**](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov) maintained by Charles Acton, Nathaniel Bachman, Boris Semenov, Edward Wright, Maria Liukis and Fraser Thompson (see corresponding [Credit and References](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/credit.html) for more).

All the C source is wrapped up into a macOS Dynamic Library (with `bundle` extension), (also has a C# source that bridges some subset of the library functionality).
