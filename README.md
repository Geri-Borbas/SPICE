# NASA's SPICE Toolkits for C
> An Observation Geometry System for Space Science Missions

[**NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility**](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/) (NAIF) offers NASA flight projects and NASA funded researchers an observation geometry information system named [**"SPICE"**](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/) to assist scientists in planning and interpreting scientific observations from space-based instruments aboard robotic spacecraft. SPICE is also widely used in mission engineering tasks associated with these missions.

## Usage

This repository simply collects and compile official [**SPICE Toolkit C sources**](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html) available to the public to a macOS Dynamic Library (also has a C# source that bridges only a thin subset of the library functionality).
